# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates an issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it does not always trigger when a user's session expires silently.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, especially when dealing with real-time updates based on user authentication status. 

The `authBug.js` file contains code illustrating the problem, while `authSolution.js` provides a solution to address the inconsistencies.

## Problem

The standard `onAuthStateChanged` listener may fail to update the UI or application state when a session expires silently, which is more common than an explicit user sign-out.  This may be due to token expiry or network issues during token refresh attempts. 

## Solution

The provided solution incorporates a mechanism to periodically check the authentication state using `currentUser` and comparing it against the previous state, thus ensuring updates regardless of `onAuthStateChanged`'s behavior. 

This approach enhances the reliability of your application by proactively monitoring the authentication status, ensuring accurate state representation in cases of silent session expiry.
